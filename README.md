# AnchorSCAD
AnchorSCAD is a Python 3D modeling API for generating [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) source code. This library simplifies the creation of 3D models and includes a suite of completed models, such as Raspberry Pi cases and others.

## AnchorSCAD Quick Start

AnchorSCAD is a Python 3D modeling API for OpenSCAD. This document covers the minimal set of concepts you need to understand in order to build shapes using AnchorSCAD.

**Note**: This document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-qAE5oR-BQ2jcotNhv5IGMNw_UzNxbYEiZat76aUy4/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Docs, which contains figures that are not provided here due to limitations when exporting markdown from Google Docs.

It's assumed that you are familiar with the Python programming language, especially classes, inheritance, dataclasses, and decorators.

For more information about [AnchorSCAD](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1yz5QjYTP7aOi6IRqGXDXWZadRwJOYG2clJnmceQCqxg/edit), follow this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1yz5QjYTP7aOi6IRqGXDXWZadRwJOYG2clJnmceQCqxg/edit).

For an overview of AnchorSCAD and how to build complex models see [html](https://owebeeone.github.io/anchorscad/) [docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D2kI2W5mLDGU19RZ1440_adDrhwZDFRImPWi2vifMag/edit?usp=sharing) - this documents in detail [shape operators (solid, hole etc)](https://owebeeone.github.io/anchorscad/#h.vmyont8is7vh) and how to [chain calls to create Makers/model graph node builders](https://owebeeone.github.io/anchorscad/#h.7w0f9846dojm).

### How do I get set up?
You can follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/owebeeone/anchorscad-core/blob/master/docs/InstallingAnchorSCAD.md) to install AnchorSCAD and the prerequisite software.

# Simple Shape
AnchorSCAD provides tools to wrap your creations in its own `Shape` class. The example below simplifies to demonstrate how shapes are composed in AnchorSCAD. The code below will print OpenSCAD script text to standard output, rendering a box tube.

![AnchorScad example1](assets/quick_start_example1.png?raw=true)

```python
# A simple composition example of a box tube using AnchorSCAD.
import anchorscad as ad

# Create a shape that we build upon.
maker = ad.Box([20, 20, 40]).solid('box').at('centre')

# Add a hole shape.
hole = ad.Box([10, 10, 40.001]).hole('hole').at('centre')
maker.add_at(hole, 'centre')

# Render and print the OpenSCAD file for the shape.
print(ad.render(maker).rendered_shape)
```

This code demonstrates how to compose models as holes and solids. AnchorSCAD also supports other OpenSCAD compositions like intersection, unions, hull, etc.

Things to note from this example:
- To compose a shape, it must be given a name and a composition mode. In this case, we have two shapes named 'box' and 'hole,' and the compositions are `solid()` and `hole()`.
- Once a shape is named, it is also given a frame of reference, becoming a builder object that can have more shapes added. Note that once a builder is added to another builder, it is copied, so subsequent changes to the added builder will not be reflected in the final composition.

# Composite Shapes
The following code snippet generates a similar box tube shape as demonstrated in the previous example but as an AnchorSCAD `Shape` class. This demonstrates AnchorSCAD’s "parametric" tools. Running this code will generate a file named "**`examples_out/anchorcad_SquarePipe_default_example.scad`**," which can also be imported into other Python programs as shown in the "[SquarePipe](https://github.com/owebeeone/anchorscad/blob/master/src/anchorscad/models/basic/SquarePipe.py)" class as a reusable shape.

![AnchorScad example2](assets/quick_start_example2.png?raw=true)

```python
import anchorscad as ad
EPSILON = 1.0e-3

@ad.shape
@ad.datatree  # wrapper over dataclasses
class SquarePipe(ad.CompositeShape):
    '''Pipe with box section consisting of an outer box with an 
    inner box hole.'''
    size: tuple
    wall_size: float = 5.0

    EXAMPLE_SHAPE_ARGS = ad.args((70, 50, 30))

    def build(self) -> ad.Maker:
        maker = ad.Box(self.size).solid('outer').at('centre')
        # Make the inner box slightly larger to stop tearing 
        # when rendered.
        inner_size = (
            self.size[0] - 2 * self.wall_size,
            self.size[1] - 2 * self.wall_size,
            self.size[2] + EPSILON
        )
        maker2 = ad.Box(inner_size).hole('hole').at('centre')
        maker.add_at(maker2, 'centre')
        return maker

MAIN_DEFAULT = ad.ModuleDefault(True)  # Set default for --write
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ad.anchorscad_main()
```

Note that the `build()` function is called via the [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) generated `__init__()` constructor function. `build()` must return the final shape (maker) object representing the constructed shape.

While it is possible to use AnchorSCAD without the [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) decorator, it greatly simplifies the code when it’s used and it’s highly recommended to use it. AnchorSCAD also extends the functionality of [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) with the `anchorscad.datatree` decorator. `Datatree` is a wrapper over `dataclass` that provides automated parameter injection and binding, allowing for the composition of many shapes without requiring manual duplication of all the parameters, defaults, and documentation. More information about `datatree` can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uTWqF82tEMreAwSKY09njCfgS8xrEtputkNFxwWj_bs/edit?usp=sharing).


# Use `template.py` to Create New Shapes
The file in the AnchorSCAD package named "[template.py](https://github.com/owebeeone/anchorscad/blob/master/src/anchorscad/template.py)" should be used as your base template when creating a new AnchorSCAD shape Python module. This file contains a simple `CompositeShape` class. The name of the class, the docstring, fields, and implementation of the `build()` function should all be specialized for the shape being coded. It makes sense to have exclusively related shapes within the same module. The template make use of [datatree](https://github.com/owebeeone/anchorscad/blob/master/src/anchorscad/datatree.py) "Node" and "self_default" features.

## `anchorscad_main()`
All AnchorSCAD shape modules should include the following lines at the end of the

 module. Running modules containing these lines will render and test the code for each shape class defined in the module.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ad.anchorscad_main()
```

By default, `ad.anchorscad_main()` does not write rendered files. However, if the `--write` command-line parameter is provided, files for each shape will be generated and placed in the "examples_out" directory in the current working directory. Alternatively, adding a module variable named `MAIN_DEFAULT` will change options defaults for `anchorscad_main()` so that files are written by default.

```python
MAIN_DEFAULT = ad.ModuleDefault(True)
```

`ad.anchorscad_main()` will also render a graph of the shape hierarchy if the `--graph_write` parameter is provided or `MAIN_DEFAULT` set to:

```python
MAIN_DEFAULT = ad.ModuleDefault(True, True, True)
```

or, to generate all example resources use:

```python
MAIN_DEFAULT = ad.ModuleDefault(all=True)
```

## CompositeShape
The `anchorscad.CompositeShape` class is the most commonly used base class, as it provides all the properties of an `anchorscad.Shape` class while also providing a scaffold for creating easy-to-use parameterized shapes with a complex shape hierarchy. In general, it's best to keep the complexity of a single `CompositeShape` class to a minimum and build a deeper hierarchy of simple `CompositeShapes` shapes.

## EXAMPLE_SHAPE_ARGS
To create example models, the `EXAMPLE_SHAPE_ARGS` class variable will be used to create a single "default" example when `anchorscad_main` or the `anchorscad_runner` is executed. The example below passes a size of (70, 50, 30) to the constructor of the `SquarePipe` shape when the example is created.

```python
class SquarePipe(ad.CompositeShape):
    ...
    EXAMPLE_SHAPE_ARGS = ad.args((70, 50, 30))
```

Having anchors rendered on the example shapes also provides a powerful diagnostic tool. It is supported by providing a list of `EXAMPLE_ANCHORS` to render. Results from the `anchorscad.surface_args` and `inner_args` functions can be used in the `EXAMPLE_ANCHORS` list. (Note: `inner_args()` will not render an anchor's parameters while `surface_args()` will).

AnchorSCAD supports multiple additional example shapes using the (unannotated) `EXAMPLES_EXTENDED` class variable containing a dictionary of "example name" keys with `anchorscad.ExampleParams` values.

# Shape Building
AnchorSCAD has a primary "Shape" type. To use a shape in AnchorSCAD, a name for the shape is **required**. A name is usually a string literal (str object) but can be any immutable, hashable, [repr](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr)-izable object, commonly a tuple of str and int if not a simple str object. Providing a "name" and a Mode to a shape results in a "NamedShape," and other optional attributes can be applied, like color, debug, or other inheritable attributes. An anchor can be applied to provide the orientation and position of the shape. A single instance of a shape could be used multiple times with a different name and `at()` location. Shapes are copied (if mutable) when added to a Maker. Below is an example of a simple Box shape being named and positioned.

![AnchorScad example2](assets/quick_start_maker.png?raw=true)

A Maker is also an `anchorscad.Shape`. A Maker, in particular, is a builder of a node in a shape hierarchy, a collection of other Maker objects. Shapes can have 'anchors' that are used to create frames of reference, i.e., Anchors have both position and orientation. The anchors in a Maker are found by looking up the name specified in the anchor with the named shapes in the Maker itself, and then applying the remaining anchor attributes to the resulting entry. There is a special case that if omitted, the first shape need not be named in the anchor, this can occasionally lead to naming ambiguity but is especially useful in preserving anchor validity when adding nodes to the shape hierarchy.

Note that the evaluated form of an anchor is represented as an `anchorscad.GMatrix` type defined in AnchorSCAD’s “linear” module (i.e., a [4x4 homogeneous matrix](https://www.brainvoyager.com/bv/doc/UsersGuide/CoordsAndTransforms/SpatialTransformationMatrices.html)). When adding another shape, you’re actually adding another Maker. The `Maker.add_at()` allows the specification of where (position + orientation) is placed relative to the shape being modified.

Note the terms “shape” and “model” are used interchangeably since an AnchorSCAD model that consists of composing many “shapes” is itself also an AnchorSCAD “Shape”.

An AnchorSCAD shape is a subclass of the `anchorscad.Shape` class. The constructor parameters are arbitrary and specific to the implemented shape. Most AnchorSCAD models use the Python dataclass or `anchorscad.datatree` decorators to simplify the generation of Shape classes.

## An Hello World / SquarePipe Example
The `anchorscad_models.basic.SquarePipe` model demonstrates the basic construction of a `CompositeShape`. The CompositeShape will likely be the most used base class in AnchorSCAD because most shapes are built from other shapes.

The resultant shape will consist of a Box with a smaller Box "hole" aligned at the centers, hence a "square pipe".

![AnchorScad example3](assets/quick_start_example3.png?raw=true)

```python
import anchorscad as ad
EPSILON = 1.0e-3

@ad.shape
@ad.datatree
class SquarePipe(ad.CompositeShape):
    '''Pipe with box section consisting of an outer box with an 
    inner box hole.'''
    size: tuple = ad.dtfield(doc='Overall size of SquarePipe shape.')
    wall_size: float = ad.dtfield(5.0, 'Wall thickness of SquarePipe shape')

    EXAMPLE_SHAPE_ARGS = ad.args((70, 50, 30))
    EXAMPLE_ANCHORS = (ad.surface_args('face_centre', 5),
                       ad.surface_args('inner', 'face_centre', 2),)

    def build(self) -> ad.Maker:
        maker = ad.Box(self.size).solid('outer').at('centre')
        # Make the inner box slightly larger to stop tearing
        # when rendered.
        inner_size = (
            self.size[0] - 2 * self.wall_size,
            self.size[1] - 2 * self.wall_size,
            self.size[2] + EPSILON
        )
        maker2 = ad.Box(inner_size).hole('hole').at('centre')
        maker.add_at(maker2, 'centre')
        return maker

    @ad.anchor('Inner hole.')
    def inner(self, *args, **kwds):
        # Make Z axis point out in holes.
        return self.maker.at('hole', *args, **kwds) * ad.ROTX_180

MAIN_DEFAULT = ad.ModuleDefault(True)  # Set default for --write
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ad.anchorscad_main()
```

The `build()` function (called by the dataclass/datatree generated constructor) after the constructor has populated the instance fields is used to create the composite shape then return the Maker object. The returned shape will have its anchors exposed as the CompositeShape object’s anchors.

AnchorSCAD modules should call `ad.anchorscad_main()` as its main function call. (use the –write command line argument or add a `MAIN_DEFAULT=ad.ModuleDefault(True)` definition in the module to generate the .scad files in the "examples_out" directory.)  When the module is run as a main program, it will identify all shapes decorated with the `@ad.shape` function and execute and render the shapes with the configured example parameters. These shape python modules can still be imported by other shape python modules to allow for complex multi-python module hierarchical shapes.

Defining shape-specific anchors is done using the `@ad.anchor` as shown with the "inner(self, *args, **kwds)" function. The function name becomes the anchor name. In this case, "inner" anchor references the 'hole' shape within the maker’s frame of reference and rotates along the X-axis so that the resulting surface anchor has the Z-axis pointing out of the shape’s surface, which is the AnchorSCAD convention.

The `maker.add_at()` function is used to anchor a shape at an anchor point in the maker. Chaining `.add_at()` calls is possible since the return value is the maker object being called, but chaining `.add_at()` calls is not always desirable.

The result of running the SquarePipe module (with `EXAMPLE_ANCHORS` removed) is the following OpenSCAD file:

```scad
// 'None : _combine_solids_and_holes'
union() {
  // '_combine_solids_and_holes'
  difference() {
    // 'default : _combine_solids_and_holes'
    union() {
      // 'default'
      multmatrix(m=[[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, -35.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, -25.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -15.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]) {
        // 'outer : _combine_solids_and_holes'
        union() {
          // 'outer'
          cube(size=[70.0, 50.0, 30.0]);
        }
      }
    }
    // 'default'
    multmatrix(m=[[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, -30.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, -20.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -15.0005], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]) {
      // 'hole : _combine_solids_and_holes'
      union() {
        // 'hole'
        cube(size=[60.0, 40.0, 30.001]);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Multi-Material Models
AnchorSCAD now supports [Multi-Material models](https://github.com/owebeeone/anchorscad/blob/master/docs/multi_material.md) using OpenScad's experimental lazy-union feature when exporting 
3mf files. All example created models will use materials "default" and "anchor". The anchor 
part of the model may be excluded from slicing if the part is configured appropriately. See the 
[Multi-Material docs](https://github.com/owebeeone/anchorscad/blob/master/docs/multi_material.md) for more information.
